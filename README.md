# AWS Security Control Policies (SCPs): Best Practices Repository

In my pursuit of effective AWS Security Control Policies (SCPs), the challenge of scouring multiple sources for robust policies suitable for immediate application on an AWS Account's inaugural day became apparent. Hence, I present a comprehensive repository of meticulously curated AWS SCPs tailored for deployment across AWS accounts within an AWS Organization.

**Important Note:** All files in this repository are in YAML format, necessitating conversion to JSON when implementing them in AWS Organizations (SCP). Alternatively, you can contribute SCPs in JSON format by sharing a PR containing a JSON Folder, and I'll seamlessly incorporate it. üòè

## Folder Structure:

- **AWS SCP Policies - Day 0:** This directory hosts SCP Policies crafted for immediate application on the day you commence AWS Organizations usage.
- **AWS SCP Policies - Post Day 0:** (To Be Continued) This section is reserved for SCP Policies designed for subsequent phases.

## Collaborative Contribution:

This repository is an open invitation for collaborative contributions to enrich the collective knowledge of security best practices. Your SCP policy insights are welcomed through PR submissions, and I am committed to collaborating with you to integrate them seamlessly.

## Attribution:

While not all policies originate from my authorship, I draw inspiration from various sources, including the official AWS SCP examples and Scott Piper's Blog, duly acknowledged here.

## Acknowledgments:

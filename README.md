# Curated AWS SCP Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

Tired of searching for good Security Control Policies (SCPs) for your AWS Account? You're in luck! I've put together a handy repository of AWS SCPs that you can easily apply to your AWS Accounts under an AWS Organization.

## Important Note

All the files here are in YAML format (not JSON). If you're copying them into AWS Organizations (SCP), you'll need to convert them into JSON. Alternatively, you can contribute SCPs in JSON format by sharing a JSON Folder as a PR, and I'll take care of the rest. üòè

## Folder Organization

- **AWS SCP Policies - Day 0:** This folder contains SCP Policies ready to go on the very day you start using AWS Organizations.
- **AWS SCP Policies - Post Day 0:** (To Be Continued) This section is reserved for SCP Policies to be applied in the future.

## Contributions Welcome!

This is a collaborative effort, and I welcome contributions from anyone interested in security best practices. Feel free to send over a Pull Request (PR), and I'll gladly work with you to add your policies to the collection.

## Acknowledgment

Not all the policies here were written by me. I've taken inspiration from various sources, including the official AWS SCP examples and [Scott Piper's Blog](https://duo.com/blog/post-author/spiper).
